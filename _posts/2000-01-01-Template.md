## Main Information
### 1. Markdown *Definition*？
**Markdown** is a lightweight **markup language** that writes documents in plain text (*easy to read, easy to write, easy to change*) and finally publishes them in HTML format.
**Markdown** can also be understood as a tool for converting languages written in MARKDOWN syntax into HTML content.  

### 2. *Who* created it?
It was co-designed by [**Aaron Swartz**](http://www.aaronsw.com/) and **John Gruber**, **Aaron Swartz** who was in last year (*January 11, 2013*) A programmer who committed suicide and had an ordinary life experience. Wikipedia's [introduction] to him (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%9A%E4%BC%A6%C2%B7%E6%96%AF%E6%B2%83% E8%8C%A8) is: **Software Engineer, Author, Political Organizer, Internet Activist, Wikipedian**.   

He has a life experience that is enough to make you bow down:
+ **14 years old** participated in the formulation of the RSS 1.0 specification standard.
+ **Enrolled **Stanford** in 2004**, then dropped out.
+ Created [Infogami](http://infogami.org/) in **2005**, and later merged with [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) to become its partner.
+ **In 2010**, he founded Demand Progress and actively participated in the activities of the Suppression of Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which was eventually withdrawn.
+ **On July 19, 2011**, he was arrested for allegedly downloading 4.8 million academic papers from MIT and JSTOR and uploading them to the Internet for free.
+ ** committed suicide in January 2013**.

### 3. *Why* should you use it?
+ It is easy to read (pleasing to the eye), easy to write (simple syntax), easy to change **plain text**. The shadow of **minimalism** is reflected everywhere.
+ Compatible with HTML, can be converted to HTML format for publishing.
+ Cross-platform use.
+ More and more websites support Markdown.
+ Organize your emails more easily and clearly. (Markdown-here, Airmail)
+ Get rid of Word.

### 4. *How* to use it?
If you don’t count **extensions**, Markdown’s syntax is absolutely **simple** and you won’t be able to put it down.

Markdown syntax is mainly divided into the following parts:
**Title**, **Paragraph**, **Block Quote**, **Code Block**, **Emphasis**, **List**, **Separator**, **Link **, **picture**, **backslash `\`**, **symbol'''**.

#### 4.1 Paragraph
Two types：  
1）Use`=`and`-`to labe first and second caption。
> First Caption   
> `=========`   
> Second Caption  
> `---------`

Result：
> First Caption  
> =========   
> Second Caption 
> ---------  

2）Use `# for six different captions。
> \# First Caption  
> \## Second Caption   
> \### Third Caption
> \#### Fourth Caption  
> \##### Fifth Caption   
> \###### Sixth Caption    

Effect：
> # First Caption  
> ## Second Caption   
> ### Third Caption
> #### Fourth Caption  
> ##### Fifth Caption   
> ###### Sixth Caption    

#### 4.2 Paragraph
There must be blank lines before and after the paragraph. The so-called blank line means that there is no text content. If you want to force a newline in a paragraph, use **two or more** spaces plus a carriage return (newlines in quotations omit carriage returns).

#### 4.3 Block Reference
Use the symbol `>` on each line of the paragraph or only on the first line, and you can also use multiple nested quotations, such as:
> \> Block reference
> \>> Nested references

Effect:
> Block reference
>> Nested references

#### 4.4 Code Block
Code blocks are created by adding 4 spaces or a tab to each line (just like writing code). like    
Ordinary paragraph:

void main()
{
     printf("Hello, Markdown.");
}

Code block:

     void main()
     {
         printf("Hello, Markdown.");
     }

**NOTE**: There is a blank line between required and normal paragraphs.

#### 4.5 Emphasis
Add `*` or `_` on both sides of the emphasized content, such as:
> \*italic\*, \_italic\_
> \*\*bold\*\*,\_\_bold\_\_

Effect:
> *italics*, _italics_
> **bold**, __bold__

#### 4.6 List
Use `·`, `+`, or `-` to mark unordered lists, such as:
> \-(+\*) first item
> \-(+\*) second term
> \- (+\*) third term

**NOTE**: There must be at least one _space_ or _tab_ after the tag. If it is not in a quoted block, there must be a blank line between it and the preceding paragraph.

Effect:
> + first item
> + second item
> + third item

The marking method of the ordered list is to replace the above symbols with numbers, supplemented by `.`, such as:
> 1. The first item
> 2. Second item
> 3. The third item

Effect:
> 1. The first item
> 2. The second item
> 3. The third item

#### 4.7 Dividing line
The most commonly used dividing line is three or more `*`, and `-` and `_` can also be used.

#### 4.8 Links
Links can be generated in two forms: **inline** and **reference**.
**Inline**:
> \[younghz's Markdown library\]\(https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown"\).

Effect:
> [younghz's Markdown library](https://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown").

**Reference formula**:
> \[younghz's Markdown library 1\]\[1\]
> \[younghz's Markdown library 2\]\[2\]
> \[1\]: https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown"
> \[2\]: https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown"

Effect:
>[younghz’s Markdown library 1][1]
>[younghz’s Markdown library 2][2]

[1]: https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown"
[2]: https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown"

**Note**: The above `[1]:https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown "Markdown"` does not appear in the block.

#### 4.9 Pictures
The form of adding a picture is similar to that of a link, just add a `! `.
#### 4.10 Backslash `\`
Equivalent to **anti-sense** effect. Make the symbol a normal symbol.
#### 4.11 Symbol '`'
Act as a marker. like:
>\`ctrl+a\`

Effect:
>`ctrl+a`

#### 5. *Who* is using it?
Markdown users:
+ GitHub
+ simple book
+ Stack Overflow
+Apollo
+ Moodle
+ Reddit
+ wait

#### 6. Give it a try
+ Plugins under **Chrome** such as `stackedit` and `markdown-here` are very convenient, and you don’t have to worry about platform restrictions.
+ Dillinger.io reviews are also good **online**
+ MarkdownPad under **Windowns** has also been used, but the experience of the free version is not very good.
+ Mou under **Mac** is contributed by Chinese people, and has a good reputation.
+ ReText under **Linux** is good.

**Of course, the ultimate state is always grammar in writing, formatting in mind :). **

****
**Note**: Different Markdown interpreters or tools have different interpretations of the corresponding syntax (extended syntax). For details, please refer to the tool's instructions.
Although someone wanted to come forward to create a so-called standardized Markdown, [I didn't expect to anger the living founder John Gruber]
(http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/).
****
The above is basically the syntax of all traditonal markdown.

### Miscellaneous:
Use of lists (non traditonal markdown):

Use `|` to represent the vertical boundary of the table. The table header and table content are separated by `-`, and `:` can be used to set the alignment. If there is `:` on both sides, it means centering. If no `:` is added, it defaults to left alignment. .
