## Main Information
### 1. Research Progress
#### 1.1 Paper 1 (Submitted) :
> + Technical and economic performance assessment of blue hydrogen production using new configuration through modelling and simulation
> + Journal: International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control
> + Manuscript Number: JGGC-D-23-00553
> + In this paper, my primary contribution is mainly to construct aspen based models for the blue hydrogen production, and Dr Alasdair N Campbell helps to review the paper. Mr. Yiming Li is the first author of this paper.

#### 1.2 Paper 2 (writing stage) :
> + Techno-economic assessment of electrolytic hydrogen production under dynamic operations(Temporary)
> + Target Journal: International Journal of Hydrogen Energy
> + Author:Haotian Ma,Zhan Xu, Dr Bahman Amini Horri,Sai Gu
> + In this paper, my primary contribution is to construct the model and write the paper, Mr.Zhan Xu from University of Birmingham helped to calculate the LCOH of the hydrogen production system, while the Dr.Horri provided the necessary data and patent for analysing.

#### 1.3 Paper 3 (writing stage) :
> + A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach to MEA Database Development and Evaluation in PEM Electrolysers
> + Target Journal: International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control
> + Author: Haotian Ma, Haoxin Ma, Gongjin Chen, Dr.Leandro L Minku
> + In this paper, my primary contribution is to construct the model and write the paper,Miss Haoxin Ma from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences provided the necessary algorithm coding support, Mr.Gongjin Chen from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology helped to construct and optimize the database, and Dr.Leandro L Minku from University of Birmingham is the reviewer of the paper.

### 2. Teaching and Learning Updates
> + Teaching: I am currently the teaching assistant of following courses from School of Engineering: Bridging Maths Programme and Electromechanical System Design.
> + Learning: I have participated the audited course from the School of Statistics and School of Computer Science for the following courses: CS409(Algorithmic Game Theory), SC410(Formal Systems Development), ST413(Bayesian Statistics and Decision Theory), ES4F0(Advanced Control Systems), CS910(Foundations of Data Analytics)

### 3. Adminstration & Business Progress
> + There is no significant progress in this part.

### 4. Next Week's Plan
> + Regenerate the third chapter of the paper.
> + Using LTSPICES for analysing the given system,try to draw the model of it.
