## Main Information
### 1. Research Progress
#### 1.1 Paper 2 (Writting Stage) :
> + Prof.Philip Mawby recommended utilizing LTSpice for crafting an equivalent circuit of our model, with an added goal of conducting a Fourier analysis. To fulfil this, I've designed an equivalent circuit representation for a rudimentary electrolyser setup and scheduled a follow-up meeting for deeper discussion. Shifting our perspective from treating the electrolyser purely as a chemical system to considering it akin to an electronic apparatus. This approach simplifies digital simulation processes and facilitates the subsequent transformation of these simulations into actionable analytical data.
> + Concurrently, a research associate from Prof.Jihong Wang's team has offered insights into my ongoing work and extended an invitation for a more comprehensive discussion of our current progress in an upcoming meeting this week. Details of this interaction will be captured in the report due the following week.


### 2. Teaching and Learning Updates
> + Teaching&Learning Updates
Prof.Natasha Khovanova has a little concern to my interdisciplinary course selection and wanted to have a meeting with me this week, I will keep you updated once the meeting is over.


### 3. Adminstration & Business Progress
> + There is no significant progress in this part.


### 4. Next Week's Plan
> + Construct the numerical simulation of the model.
> + Begin to write the third phase report.
