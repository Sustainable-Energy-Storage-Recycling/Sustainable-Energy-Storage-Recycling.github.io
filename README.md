Welcome to the **GitHub Homepage** of the  **Intelligent Energy System Lab** led by **Prof.Sai Gu** at the **University of Warwick**. 


The **Intelligent Energy System Lab**(IESL) focuses on the study of hydrogen economy, pays closed attention to the **functionalized materials** including **electrodes**, **membranes**,**catalysts**, and **porous transport layer**. By applying **machine learning** and **virtural reality** tools,we further enhance the impact of our research and make it significant to change the daily life.
